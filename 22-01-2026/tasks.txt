Hands-On Task: Build a Simple Student Grade Tracker
 Objective
Create a small Python program that:
Uses functions with different types of parameters (*args, **kwargs)
Demonstrates return values, closures, and lambda functions
Imports and uses a standard library module
📘 Task Description
You need to build a grade tracking system with the following requirements:

Add Students
    Create a function add_students(*names) that takes a variable number of student names and returns a list of them

Record Grades
    Write a function record_grades(**grades) that takes keyword arguments (where the key is the student name and the value is the grade).|

Calculate Average (Closure)
    Create a closure create_avg_calculator() that returns a function add_score(score) which keeps track of total scores and number of entries, and returns the current average after each call.

Use a Lambda Function
    Write a one-line lambda function that increases all grades by 5 points.

Use a Built-in Module
    Import the statistics module and use statistics.mean() to calculate the average of a list of grades.

Global Variable Practice
    Create a global variable grade_scale = "A-F".
    Write a function set_grade_scale(scale) that changes this global variable using the global keyword.

Final Output
    Print a summary showing:
    All student names
    Their grades
    The overall average
    The current grading scale
Bonus Challenge
Add a function top_students(grades_dict, threshold) that uses a list comprehension to return a list of students scoring above the given threshold.
