1.1 Temperature Converter: Write a function called convert_celsius_to_fahrenheit that takes a Celsius temperature as a parameter and returns the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature. The formula is: Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.
1.2 Area of a Rectangle: Write a function called calculate_rectangle_area that takes the length and width of a rectangle as parameters and returns its area. Provide default values for length and width (e.g., 1).
1.3 String Reverser: Write a function called reverse_string that takes a string as a parameter and returns the reversed string.
1.4 Calculate Tip: Write a function called calculate_tip that takes the bill amount and tip percentage as parameters (with a default tip percentage of 15%). Return the tip amount.

2.1 Area Calculation: Create a function called calculate_area that takes two arguments, length and width, and returns the area of a rectangle. Call the function with different values for length and width using both positional and keyword arguments.
2.2 List Modification: Create a function called add_item that takes a list and an item as arguments. The function should add the item to the end of the list. Test the function with different lists and items. Experiment with creating a copy of the list inside the function to avoid modifying the original list.
2.3 String Formatting: Create a function called format_address that takes three arguments: street, city, and state. The function should return a formatted address string in the following format: "{street}, {city}, {state}". Use keyword arguments when calling the function.
2.4 Default Greeting: Modify the greet function from the examples to include a default greeting message (e.g., "Hello"). The function should take an optional greeting argument. If the greeting argument is not provided, it should use the default greeting message.

3.1 Modify the Discount: Change the calculate_price function to accept the discount_rate as an argument instead of using a global variable. What are the advantages of doing this?
3.2 Nested Function Challenge: Create a function called grandparent that contains two nested functions: parent and child. grandparent should have a local variable. The parent function should modify this variable using nonlocal, and the child function should print the modified value.
3.3 Global Constant: Define a global constant PI = 3.14159. Write a function calculate_circle_area(radius) that uses this constant to calculate the area of a circle.

4.1 Temperature Conversion: Write a program that takes a temperature in Celsius as input from the user, converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula F = (C * 9/5) + 32, and prints the result. Use input(), float(), and print().
4.2 String Length and Reversal: Write a program that takes a string as input, prints its length using len(), and then prints the reversed string using reversed().
4.3 Finding the Range: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) of the numbers. Use max(), min(), and a return statement within the function.
4.4 List to String: You have a list of characters. Create a single string from these characters using the str() function in a loop.

5.1 Area of a Trapezoid: Create a function calculate_trapezoid_area(base1, base2, height) that calculates the area of a trapezoid. The formula is: area = (base1 + base2) / 2 * height.
5.2 Area of a Square: Create a function calculate_square_area(side) that calculates the area of a square. The formula is: area = side * side.
5.3 Combined Area: Create a function calculate_combined_area(rectangle_length, rectangle_width, circle_radius) that calculates the combined area of a rectangle and a circle. Use the previously defined functions calculate_rectangle_area and calculate_circle_area inside this function.
5.4 Error Handling: Modify the calculate_rectangle_area function to check if the length or width are negative. If either is negative, return an error message (a string) instead of calculating the area. You could return "Invalid input: Length and width must be positive."
