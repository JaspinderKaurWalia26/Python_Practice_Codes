Read Mode ('r'): This mode is used for reading data from a file.
                 If the file doesn't exist, Python will raise a FileNotFoundError

Write Mode ('w'): This mode is used for writing data to a file. 
                  If the file exists, its contents will be overwritten. 
                  If the file doesn't exist, Python will create a new file.

Append Mode ('a'): This mode is used for adding data to the end of an existing file. 
                    If the file doesn't exist, Python will create a new file. 
                    The existing content of the file is preserved.

Exclusive Creation Mode ('x'): This mode is used for creating a new file, but only if it doesn't already exist.
                                 If the file exists, Python will raise a FileExistsError.

Binary Mode ('b'): This mode is used for working with binary files, such as images or audio files. 
                    It can be combined with any of the other modes (e.g., 'rb' for reading a binary file, 'wb' for writing a binary file).

Text Mode ('t'): This mode is used for working with text files. 
                 It's the default mode if you don't specify one. 
                 It can be combined with any of the other modes (e.g., 'rt' for reading a text file, 'wt' for writing a text file).

Update Mode ('+'): This mode allows you to both read and write to a file. 
                    It must be combined with one of the other modes (e.g., 'r+' for reading and writing to an existing file, 'w+' for creating a new file for reading and writing).



open() -> open(filename, mode) - open file in python, syntax 
close() -> file.close - to close a file   
with - safe way to work with file, you do not need to close the file explicitly
