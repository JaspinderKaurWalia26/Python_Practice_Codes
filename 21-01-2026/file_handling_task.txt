1.1 File Reader: Write a program that prompts the user for a filename and then opens the file in read mode. If the file exists, display its contents. If the file doesn't exist, display an error message.
1.2 File Writer: Write a program that prompts the user for a filename and then opens the file in write mode. Prompt the user to enter lines of text, and write each line to the file until the user enters "DONE".
1.3 File Appender: Write a program that prompts the user for a filename and then opens the file in append mode. Prompt the user to enter lines of text to append to the file until the user enters "DONE"
1.4 Log File Creator: Create a simple log file creator. The program should ask the user for a log message and append it to a log file named app.log with a timestamp.
2.1 Word Count: Write a Python script that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it. Assume words are separated by spaces. Consider how you would handle punctuation. Use the my_file.txt created earlier or create a new one with more text.
2.2 Specific Line Retrieval: Write a function that takes a filename and a line number as input, and returns the content of that specific line in the file. Handle the case where the line number is out of range (i.e., greater than the number of lines in the file). Use readline() for this exercise.
2.3 Chunked Processing: Create a function that reads a large file in chunks of 1024 bytes and prints each chunk. This simulates how you might process very large files that cannot fit into memory all at once.
3.1 Create a program that takes user input and writes it to a file named user_input.txt. Each line of input should be written as a separate line in the file.
3.2 Write a program that reads a list of names from the user and appends them to a file named names.txt. Ensure that the file is created if it doesn't exist.
3.3 Create a program that writes the numbers from 1 to 100 to a file named numbers.txt, each on a new line.
