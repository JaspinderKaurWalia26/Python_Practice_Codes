# Pandas and Matplotlib Practice Tasks

This folder contains hands-on practice tasks for the **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** libraries in Python.  
The tasks focus on real-world data handling, analysis, and visualization.

---

## Contents Overview

### 1. Pandas Tasks
All Pandas-related tasks **along with their solutions** are implemented in the file:

- `tasks.py`

The **task descriptions only** are documented separately in:

- `tasks.txt`

#### Pandas Topics Covered:
- Creating DataFrames manually
- Column selection
- Aggregation using `.mean()`
- Conditional filtering using `.loc` and boolean indexing
- Handling missing values using `.isnull()`, `.fillna()`, and `.dropna()`
- Reading data from CSV files
- Statistical analysis using `.describe()`
- Sorting data using `.sort_values()`
- Creating new calculated columns

---

### 2. Datasets Used
The following CSV files are used for Pandas tasks:

- `employee_data.csv`  
  Used for employee-related data analysis and missing value handling.

- `website_data.csv`  
  Used for SEO and website performance analysis.

---

### 3. Matplotlib Tasks
Matplotlib visualization tasks are implemented in:

- `graph.py`

#### Visualization Types:
- Bar Chart (Service Comparison)
- Line Plot (Weekly Website Traffic)

---

### 4. Output Files
The generated plots are saved as image files:

- `Task1.png` → Bar Chart (Service Comparison)
- `Task2.png` → Line Plot (Weekly Website Traffic)

These images represent the final output of the Matplotlib tasks.
